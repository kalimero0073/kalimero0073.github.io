I was born in a medium-size city in Austria and raised in the countryside near the beautiful lake Attersee. Coming from a rather big family I am used to be surrounded by people. I like to exchange ideas with other individuals and thereby improve my reasoning. There are so many interesting topics I admire, but the most interesting by far, for me at least, is what computer science has to offer. Although I started relatively late to explore its intricacies, back then I was already 23, I managed to get a decent understanding of how one can leverage a computer to solve a seemingly unlimited number of issues. Nevertheless, there are still so many things I am looking forward to understand and learn. This ignorance I am made aware of every new day while reading about awesome achievements and future trends, keeps me motivated to keep pushing forward and improve my level of knowledge and experience one step at a time.
